This repository contains the backend code for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing clubs. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing club data, including creating new clubs, retrieving club details, updating club information, and deleting clubs. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js framework, and it uses a JSON file (clubs.json) as the data store.

The backend application utilizes various dependencies such as cors for handling cross-origin resource sharing, body-parser for parsing request bodies, multer for handling file uploads, and fs and util for file operations. It also includes necessary routes and controllers for processing different API requests.

The repository structure includes the main server.js file, which serves as the entry point for the backend application. Additionally, there is a clubs.json file that serves as the data storage for club information. The repository also includes a vercel.json configuration file for deploying the backend to Vercel.

The purpose of this repository is to provide the backend functionality for the CRUD operations related to managing clubs. It can be used as a standalone backend server or integrated with a frontend application to create a complete club management system.
